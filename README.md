This is a really simple Sinatra app that talks to the database created as part of the [Active Places](https://github.com/chrisroos/activeplaces) project and exposes the data as KML.  It was created at [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org/projects/active-places-reloaded).

It should really be part of the main Active Places app.  But it's not.  Yet.
